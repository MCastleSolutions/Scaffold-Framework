Scaffold is an experimental YAML based Android framework written in Kotlin. It aims to provide a mean of dynamic UI. There is a list of features:

  - An approach of UI definition that gives a sense of direct representation for visual elements.
  - A restricted remote definition of UI elements that allows design changes at server side while ensuring security.
